<h1>Hi, I'm Ryan</h1>
	<header>
		Welcome! Im glad to see you have enough interest to visit my website. If you can spare a couple minutes of your time, I promise to keep it brief and informative.
		<br>
		<br>
		This is my resume in case you would like it.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p class="Introduction">
		Assuming you are interested in who I am, you've come to the right place. To get the basics out of the way:
			<div><p class="Info">
				Undergradute at UC Santa Cruz, graduating June 2022
				<br>
				Double Major in Business Management Economics and Computational Math
				<br>
				Currently Located in Santa Cruz, CA
			</p></div>
		<br>
		Neato, now that we have that addressed I'll dive more into what makes me, me. I enjoy rock climbing,

		<input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle">
		<span class="sidenote">
		I am still not fully convinced anyone actually enjoys running, but I do partake in it regularly.
		</span>
		, and working on various projects in python. I can bake a mean apple pie, solve a variety of rubiks cubes, and replace the cv axles on a 2008 4Runner. While all these things are fairly unreleated, they each have their own aspect of puzzle solving that I find extremely rewarding.

		<h2>Career Prospects</h2>
		<p class="career">
		I am highly intrigued by the work of a
		data scientist. I am amazed to see the way that data is handled in creative ways through linear algebra and various other math subjects. Overall, it seems like a great way to productively solve puzzles all day long. From my understanding, a strong background in math alone will not be enough to excel in a data oriented field. There is a level of programming competency required, to which I have responded by building up a functional set of skills. 
		I have been using a mix of personal projects and Udemy or other online resources to attempt to supplement computer science classes. While I believe this is a step in the right direction, it is difficult to know what is lacking from my knowledge base. Nonetheless, I am trying to develop myself into a valuable asset, in hopes of enabling me to do what I enjoy.

	<h2>
		Projects
	</h2>
	<p>For all my projects I chose to use Jupyter Lab, mostly for the ease of presentation later on and because it seemed like a flexible platform. These projects have been good sources for me to learn new techniques of tackling problems, and learning various other coding related snippets of information. They are by no means perfect, but I think they give some insight to my personal approach to problem solving. I do wish I had a process for recieving criticism or feedback on them, so be forewarned of spelling errors or suboptimal programs. I will do my best to keep them updated, as I periodically revisit them to expand on them.
